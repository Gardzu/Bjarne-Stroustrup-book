//I have combined tasks from 19 to 21 because each next complemented the last one. 
// I tried to make two sets of name of some pupil and his/her score somewhere. Input stops after user enters "noname 0". 
// At the end the program prints every pair in a console.

// In the task 20 I added the function that shows user score of some pupil or output error.

// In the task 21 my program was modified again and now shows its user names of pupils which have the same score as he/she wrote.
